Hello, my name is Davide and I am a master thesis student working on a polymeric bioresorbable stent. I would like to print this drawing (as you see in the files) in a pattern
so that the extruder never goes backward in the orange arrow direction (or at least, it goes backward the least possible).
Thanks in advance :)
